Title: Court Vacancy Injects New Uncertainty Into Rancorous Election Battle

Body: The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has put enormous new pressure on the two candidates in a presidential race already roiled by a global pandemic and a summer of civil unrest, raising the prospect of a contentious Senate confirmation battle waged side by side with the campaign and thrusting a constellation of red-hot issues — from abortion and gay rights to religious liberty and environmental regulation — to the foreground of national politics.

The Supreme Court may quickly become a shared focal point for the candidates in a contest that has unfolded, so far, as though the two parties inhabit different universes. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, has built a strong lead over President Trump by focusing on the president’s handling of the pandemic, while Mr. Trump has attempted to make up ground with dark and largely fictitious forecasts of looming insurrection by left-wing radicals.

The president signaled even before Justice Ginsburg’s death on Friday that he intended to inject judicial politics into the final stretch of the 2020 campaign. He released a new list of potential nominees earlier this month to motivate conservative voters who have grown demoralized during a year of political tribulations. But it was not clear that his right-wing coalition would be more motivated by a confirmation fight than the alliance of liberals and moderates supportive of Mr. Biden would be.

The former vice president has built a lead over Mr. Trump with lopsided support from women, people of color, moderates and college-educated whites — groups likelier to be alarmed than allured by the possibility of a court that tilts far to the right. Though he is well ahead of Mr. Trump in the polls, Mr. Biden has struggled to excite progressive voters and young people, who draw inspiration of a different kind from a far-reaching struggle over social policy and civil rights.
